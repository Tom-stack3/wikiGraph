# Wiki Graph - Getting to Philosophy

A script created to check the **"Getting to Philosophy"** phenomenon:\
Clicking on the first link in the main text of an English Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for
subsequent articles, leads to the Philosophy article.

You are welcome to read more about this interesting phenomenon
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

I created a python script which "plays" this "game" and generates a nice Graph showing the paths created by clicking the
first link in a Wikipedia article.\
For example the following graph, which ran on these first pages:\
"Russia", "Space", "Coronavirus", "Art", "LeBron James","Real Madrid" and "Formula One".\

## Installations

1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Install Graphviz from here: https://www.graphviz.org/download/ and **make sure** that the directory containing the
   dot executable is on your **systems‚Äô path** !

### Libraries used:

- [bs4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to scrape information from web pages easily.
- [wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
- [Graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/) to create and render graphs.

## Running the script

There are three options to run:

1. `draw_pages.py`:

   Gets a list of Wikipedia article names to draw. The program finds the closest article to each name entered and draws
   the graph for the pages chosen.

   e.g:\
   `python draw_pages.py formula 1, Nervous system, Road Bicycle Racing, minerals, baseball, cafe`

   Results in the following graph:

   , [6_1.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tom-stack3/wikiGraph/master/output_examples/6_1.pdf))

   [6 Formula One+Nervous system+Road bicycle racing.svg](./output_examples/6_1.svg)

2. `draw_random.py`:

   Gets a list of integers. For each number in the arguments, the script generates and draws a graph, with randomly
   chosen articles. Each integer corresponds for the number of random articles in a drawing.

   e.g:
   `python draw_random.py 10 18`

   Results in two graphs. One with 10 randomly chosen Wikipedia articles to start with, and one with 18 randomly chosen
   Wikipedia articles to start with.

## How we decide what to click on?

Following the chain consists of:

- Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link.
- Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links (links to non-existent pages).
- Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs.

The function that decides what we should click-on is: ```is_href_valid()```, located in the ```WikiPage.py```, in
class ```WikiPage```. It gets a href html tag, parsed with bs4(BeautifulSoup) and decides if it is valid to click on or
not. If the page is valid - it returns ```True```, otherwise - ```False```.\
You can go take a look on the checks it does, but in general we check the following stuff:

1. It is indeed a link to a Wikipedia article. Meaning it is not an external link to somewhere outside Wikipedia.

2. It is not a link enclosed in brackets.\
   For example in [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) the first link that is clicked shouldn't
   be ```(üîälisten)```, ```Greek``` or ```·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ∑```. The right link to click on is ```branch of philosophy``` instead.

3. It is not a side-comment, meaning the link is not in the following tags:
    1. italicized (```<i>```)
    2. smaller text (```<small>```)
    3. supper text (```<sup>```)

4. It is not a link to a disambiguation
   page <i>( [disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Disambiguation_pages) )</i>.

## How the graph is generated?

To generate the graph, I use a very convenient open-source library I found called [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).

## Output formats

The [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) library supports tons of output formats (
their [documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html)). In this project I preferred to use **.SVG** and
**.PDF** files. Both preserve "quality" when zooming in.

One advantage of **.SVG** over **.PDF** files is that it allows adding URL links onto nodes, a feature which I found
very useful. Consequently, the nodes of the graphs in the **.SVG** files are clickable and lead to the Wikipedia page
they represent.

## Loops found üòØ

Of course the "[Getting to Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy)" phenomenon
doesn't happen in 100% percent of the cases, and they are some loopholes in it. Some interesting loops of Wikipedia
articles I found:

- [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) ‚ûú [rules of inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference)
  ‚ûú [Logical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_form) ‚ûú [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) again :)
- [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)
  ‚ûú [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States)
  ‚ûú [U.S. states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state)
  ‚ûú [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)  again :)
- [Carbon fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibers) ‚ûú [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber)
  ‚ûú [Carbon fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibers) again :)\
  <small>notice that the first two links in [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) are local links, leading to a
  section in the article, so we ignore and skip them:
  ... "*is a <a href="#Natural_fibers">natural</a> or <a href="#Man-made_fibers">man-made</a> substance*"
  ...</small>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="./output_examples/loops_examples/logic.svg" width="75%"></th>
    <th><img src="./output_examples/loops_examples/usa.svg" width="75%"></th> 
    <th><img src="./output_examples/loops_examples/carbon_fibers.svg" width="75%"></th>
  </tr>
 </table>

## So.. what does Philosophy lead to?

As surprising as it sounds, Philosophy also leads to Philosophy ü•≥ü•≥\
You can see its path here: [philosophy path](./output_examples/loops_examples/philosophy.svg)\
