# Wiki Graph
A script created to check the **"Getting to Philosophy"** phenomenon:\
Clicking on the first link in the main text of an English Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, leads to the Philosophy article.

You are welcome to read more about this interesting phenomenon here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

I created a python script which "plays" this "game" and generates a nice Graph showing the paths created by clicking the first link in a Wikipedia article.\
For example the following graph, which ran on these first pages:\
"Russia", "Space", "Coronavirus", "Art", "LeBron James","Real Madrid" and "Formula One".\

## How we decide what to click on?
Following the chain consists of:
- Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link.
- Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links (links to non-existent pages).
- Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs.

The function which decides what we should click-on is: ```is_href_valid()```, located in the ```WikiPage.py```,
in class ```WikiPage```.
It gets a href html tag, parsed with bs4(BeautifulSoup) and decides if it is valid to click on or not.
If the page is valid - it returns ```True```, otherwise - ```False```.\
You can go take a look on the checks it does, but in general we check the following stuff:
1. It is indeed a link to a Wikipedia article. Meaning it is not an external link to somewhere outside Wikipedia. 

2. It is not a link enclosed in brackets.\
   For example in [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) the first link that is clicked shouldn't be ```(üîälisten)```, ```Greek``` or ```·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ∑```. The right link to click on is``` branch of philosophy``` instead.

3. It is not a side-comment, meaning the link is not in the following tags:
   1. italicized (```<i>```)
   2. smaller text (```<small>```)
   3. supper text (```<sup>```)
    
4. It is not a link to a disambiguation page.
