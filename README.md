A script created to check the **"Getting to Philosophy"** phenomenon:\
Clicking on the first link in the main text of an English Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, leads to the Philosophy article.

You are welcome to read more about this interesting phenomenon here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

I created a python script which "plays" this "game" and generates a nice Graph showing the paths created by clicking the first link in a Wikipedia article.\
For example the following graph, which ran on these first pages:
"Russia", "Space", "Coronavirus", "Art", "LeBron James","Real Madrid" and "Formula One".
